# Get top Twitter Hashtags
An example script in Python 3 that retrieves the top 10 trending hashtags on Twitter using the tweepy library:

```python
import tweepy

# Set up your Twitter API credentials
consumer_key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
consumer_secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

# Authenticate with the Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(
    consumer_key, consumer_secret,
    access_token, access_token_secret
)

# Set up the Tweepy API client
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Retrieve the top 10 trending hashtags in your region (in this case, the USand only TOP 10 set it toyour needs)
trends = api.trends_place(23424977)[0]['trends']
hashtags = [trend['name'] for trend in trends if trend['name'].startswith('#')][:10]

# Print the top 10 trending hashtags
print('Top 10 trending hashtags on Twitter:')
for hashtag in hashtags:
    print(hashtag)
```
In this script, we use the tweepy library to authenticate with the Twitter API using OAuth 1.0a authentication. We then use the api.trends_place method to retrieve the top 50 trending topics in a specific region (in this case, the US), and extract the hashtags from the list of trends. We filter the hashtags to include only those that start with a # character, and select the top 10 hashtags by sorting the list and selecting the first 10 elements.

Note that the Twitter API has rate limits and usage restrictions that you must follow. Additionally, this script retrieves only the top 10 hashtags on Twitter, and may not reflect the most popular or relevant hashtags for your specific use case. You may need to use other data sources or algorithms to determine the most popular hashtags for a given topic or context.
